# The AI App & Agent Factory
Thank you for joining us at Microsoft Ignite 2025 as an Azure AI Foundry Agents expert for the AI App and Agent Facory station in the HUB. 

 

What is Expert Meet-up? It's your opportunity to engage in interactive one-on-one or small group discussions with our attendees. You will have the chance to answer technical questions, share demos/product and solution knowledge, and help attendees stay updated with the latest event news and product announcements. At Microsoft Ignite 2025, we'll lead attendees through a Foundry journey featuring 7 demo-focused stations. Each station will be staffed by MVPs, session speakers, and approved Subject Matter Experts like you.
