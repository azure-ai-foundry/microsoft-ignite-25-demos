# The AI App & Agent Factory
Thank you for joining us at Microsoft Ignite 2025 as an Azure AI Foundry Agents expert meetup.

 

What is Expert Meet-up? It's your opportunity to engage in interactive one-on-one or small group discussions with our attendees. You will have the chance to answer technical questions, share demos/product and solution knowledge, and help attendees stay updated with the latest event news and product announcements. At Microsoft Ignite 2025, we'll lead attendees through a Foundry journey featuring 7 demo-focused stations. Each station will be staffed by MVPs, session speakers, and approved Subject Matter Experts.
