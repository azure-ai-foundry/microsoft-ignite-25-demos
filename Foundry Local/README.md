# What is Foundry Local?
Foundry Local is an on-device AI inference solution developed by Microsoft that allows users to run AI models locally on their hardware. It provides several benefits, including performance, privacy, customization, and cost efficiency.

## Key features
- On-Device Inference: Run models locally on your own hardware, reducing dependency on cloud services while keeping your data on-device.
- Model Customization: Choose from preset models or bring your own to match your specific requirements and use cases.
- Cost Efficiency: Avoid recurring cloud service costs by using your existing hardware, making AI tasks more accessible.
- Seamless Integration: Easily interface with your applications via an endpoint.

## Use cases
Foundry Local is ideal for scenarios where:
- Data privacy and security are paramount
- You need to operate in environments with limited or no internet connectivity
- You want to reduce cloud inference costs
- You need low-latency AI responses for real-time applications
- You want to experiment with AI models before deploying to a cloud environment

## Pricing and billing
Entirely Free! You're using your own hardware, and there are no extra costs associated with running AI models locally.
